1. Problem Definition
Objective: To develop a predictive model that forecasts house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, etc.
Target Variable: House prices.
2. Data Collection
Data Sources:
Publicly available datasets like the Kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques dataset.
Real estate websites (using web scraping if needed).
Public databases from government or local real estate agencies.
Features: Collect data on various features that could affect house prices such as:
Location (city, neighborhood, proximity to amenities)
House size (square footage)
Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
Age of the house
Renovations or upgrades
Lot size
Property type (single-family, condo, etc.)
Economic factors (interest rates, market conditions).
3. Data Preprocessing
Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values (imputation, removal).
Remove duplicates.
Handle outliers.
Data Transformation:
Normalize or standardize numerical features.
Encode categorical variables (one-hot encoding, label encoding).
Feature scaling to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.
Data Splitting:
Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets (e.g., 70% training, 15% validation, 15% testing).
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate Analysis: Examine the distribution of individual features.
Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis: Study the relationships between features and the target variable.
Correlation Analysis: Identify correlations between features to detect multicollinearity.
Visualization: Use plots (scatter plots, box plots, histograms) to visualize trends, outliers, and relationships.
5. Feature Engineering
Feature Selection:
Use techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Lasso regression, or feature importance from models to select the most significant features.
Feature Creation:
Create new features from existing ones (e.g., price per square foot, age of the house).
Dimensionality Reduction:
Apply PCA or other techniques if needed to reduce the number of features.
6. Model Selection
Algorithm Choice:
Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting Machines (XGBoost, LightGBM)
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Neural Networks (for more complex models)
Model Training:
Train different models on the training set.
Hyperparameter Tuning:
Use Grid Search, Random Search, or Bayesian Optimization to fine-tune model parameters.
7. Model Evaluation
Metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared (RÂ²)
Validation:
Evaluate model performance on the validation set.
Cross-Validation:
Use k-fold cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness.
8. Model Deployment
Implementation:
Deploy the model using a web framework (like Flask or Django) or as an API.
User Interface:
Create a simple user interface where users can input features and get a predicted house price.
Monitoring:
Continuously monitor model performance and retrain it with new data as needed.
9. Documentation and Reporting
Documentation:
Document all the steps taken, from data collection to model deployment.
Reporting:
Create a report or presentation that summarizes the project, highlighting key findings, model performance, and potential improvements.
10. Future Improvements
Explore additional features like economic indicators, crime rates, and school quality.
Experiment with advanced models like ensemble methods or deep learning.
Continuously update the model with new data to improve its accuracy over time.
